## Hi 👋, Welcome to my world！📫 My name is Wubiao Huang (黄武彪)

- 🔭 I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [the School of Geodesy and Geomatics](http://main.sgg.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). I received the B.Sc. degree from [the College of Computer and Imformation Engineering](https://cs.xmut.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Xiamen University of Technology](https://www.xmut.edu.cn/), and the M.Sc.degree from [the College of Geological Engineering and Geomatics](https://dcxy.chd.edu.cn/) at [Chang'an University](https://www.chd.edu.cn/).

- 🌱 My main research interests include deep learning, computer vision, geological hazard identification and analysis, remote sensing semantic segmentation, knowledge graphs, and multimodal large models.
